### B.I.O🧬
My name is Daniil. I like coding. I started programming at the age of 13, at that time I was working as GameDev. And about two years ago I abandoned GameDev. I decided to try something new. I started, like many others, with the development of websites and bots. And I was drawn in, then I began to delve more into it and chose the direction: Backend. I chose a language and started making Parsers, bots and much more. Now we're off to 2024, I'm 21 y.o and can't find a job.
